With over 30 years of experience in Guam real estate, Kun Ho is truly a seasoned veteran in the industry. He has helped his clients navigate through every economic up-and-down turn since 1990 and can find value that few others see through his deep knowledge of the island’s property values and current developments. He has served a wide variety of clients, from local residents and military members to foreign investors from Korea and Japan.

Kun Ho enjoys coaching high school and club soccer and tending a fruit garden that grows bananas and mangoes.
